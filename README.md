# GitDigital Products - Central Hub & Roadmap

**Mission:** This is the central source of truth and CEO plan for the Gitdigital-products organization. It hosts the organizational roadmap, strategic decisions, and documents the primary revenue driver for our MVP. This repository is for internal alignment and stakeholder communication.

## 🗺️ Organizational Roadmap (PHASE 1 — CLARITY + CORE INFRA)

**DECISION: Primary Revenue Driver MVP Selected.**
**🏆 Solana KYC Compliance SDK** is our primary revenue driver for PHASE 1.
**Rationale:** Targets a clear, high-value enterprise pain point (institutional compliance), has the most advanced codebase, and offers a defensible moat with regulatory-tech complexity. This gives us the fastest path to validated revenue.

**Parallel Strategic Project:** The **Dynamic NFT Framework** will be developed as an R&D initiative, with its timeline contingent on the traction and resources generated by the primary driver.

### Phase 1 Execution Timeline:
1.  **Weeks 1-2 (Clarity):** Finalize repo missions, owner assignments, and GitHub Projects for all key repos. ✅ *[In Progress]*
2.  **Weeks 2-4 (Core Infra):** Secure all CI/CD pipelines. Complete KYC SDK MVP feature spec and publish Project Board.
3.  **Month 2 (Launch Prep):** KYC SDK pilot deployment with first partner. dNFT framework architecture finalized.

### Next Steps:
1.  Finalize and document the primary MVP choice in this section.
2.  Create a GitHub Project linked to this repo to track organization-level epics.
3.  Review and implement the standardized README missions across all repositories.
